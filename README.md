# NewsHub - A News App

This is my personal project which I have made to learn the concepts of React.js.
It fetches news articles from NewsApi.
It has a homepage and different topics for the user to choose from.

Also implemented several features like:
- Infinite Scrolling Component.
- Loading bar at top of screen like YouTube.
